/**
 * Shop at this region's shop.
 * Since this uses a copy of the Region's shop, the shop will reset once you are done shopping.
 * 
 * 
 * Algorithm:
 * Loop everything below this until the user decides to leave the shop.
 * Have the user choose if they want to buy or sell.
 * Then, have them choose if they want to deal with items or weapons.
 * Also, give them the option to check what each player is already carrying (print all item and weapon inventories).
 * Then, choose which player you want to buy or sell weapons / items.
 * 
 * Once all of these factors have been determined, get the Region's shop (region.getShop())
 * and call one of the 4 functions from Shop.cpp (buyItem, sellItem, buyWeapon, sellWeapon).
 * 
 * @param traded: true if you already bought or sold something in the shop. This is false when called from actionMenu()
 * @return true if a player bought or sold something.
 * @return false if no trade took place.

 * passTime function

 * @param fortune: The chance that you will have something good happen to you. Decimal percent.
 * @param misfortune: The chance that something bad will happen to you. Decimal percent.
 * @return true if a battle or injury misfortune occurred. This will be used to determine if sleep is interrupted.
 * 
 * Algorithm:
 * 1. Display the time. displayTime();
 * 2. Roll for fortune. If you encounter a fortune, decrease the chances of misfortune by 20%.
 * 3. Roll for misfortune. If misfortune strikes, roll a die for a value 1 through 6.
 *    Rolling a 1 or 2 results in minor damage like tripping over something. player.takeDamage(amount);
 *    Rolling a 3 results in losing an item, weapon, or coins.
 *    Rollin a 4, 5, or 6 results in a battle. Trigger battleToTheDeath().
