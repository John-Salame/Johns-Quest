    At the start of playTheGame(), call the intro function if

    What happens:
    Time: Day 0, Hour 8
    You are a king travelling his kingdom after being informed that the past two shipments
    from your greatest port town, Entrana, have not shown up.
    Suspicious that something might be amiss, you decide to check out the situation yourself
    and punish any wrongdoing which might be at hand.
    --> Enter your name: King ____ (King John by default)
    When you arrive at the town, you are stopped at the gate. You notice a few thugs loitering there.
    "Oi! Don't you know the rules of this town? If you want to pass by us, you gotta pay up.
    If you refuse, we'll beat you so bad you'll wish you were dead."
    Without you noticing, one of the thugs quietly sneaks behind you and takes your sword.
    "You're unarmed. You better pay up if you want to live! And you won't be getting this back either!
    No weapons in this town unless you're part of the Armani gang!"
    You don't believe it. Your richest port town has been infiltrated and taken over by mere thugs!
    
    Finally, one of the thugs recognizes you.
    "HEY! That's King ____! If we get rid of him, big boss will reward us with all the riches we can dream of!
    We're not letting this one get away, boys!"
    THREE THUGS ATTACK YOU, ONE ARMED WITH YOUR SWORD. All you have to fight with are your fists.
       (Whether you win or lose, you collapse from exhaustion after the battle ends.
       A traveling adventurer finds you on the ground, fends of any remaining attackers, 
       and escorts you to the doctor. You wake up fully healed. 
       Pass the time by two hours with fortune .50 and misfortune 0).
    When you wake up, the traveler is still there. He tells you,
